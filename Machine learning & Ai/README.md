## 🧠 Types of AI and Machine Learning

There are several classifications of AI and ML, each with its own characteristics and applications.

### 🤖 Types of AI
| **Type of AI**          | **Description**                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Narrow AI**           | AI designed to perform a specific task (e.g., facial recognition, language translation). Also known as Weak AI. |
| **General AI**          | Hypothetical AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can. General AI does not yet exist.              |
| **Superintelligent AI** | AI that far exceeds human intelligence. This is a theoretical concept and raises ethical concerns.              |

### 🔄 Types of Machine Learning
| **Type of ML**              | **Description**                                                                                         |
