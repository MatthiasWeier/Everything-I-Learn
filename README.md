> [!CAUTION]
> - I use ChatGPT (my own GPT: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-MYdRG6S9E-markdowngpt-for-it-documentation) to create a lot of these documents.
> - I am still reading through and fact check everything.
> - Usually I give the GPT a lot of information I already gathered to a topic and it creates me a markdown page. Quite useful, if you want you can try it
>  - I can't approve you that 100% information in here are correct.
>   - BUT I give my best to always read through everything multiple times. I also learn with this stuff, if I notice anything wrong I will change it. This will get more over time
